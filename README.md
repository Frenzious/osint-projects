# OSINT Projects by Tal Shamayev

A collection of personal Open-Source Intelligence investigations and simulations.  
These showcase my ability to find, analyze, and structure information using public data and digital research techniques.

## Case Studies

### Digital Footprint Analysis
Traced a persona across multiple platforms using advanced search operators, metadata extraction, and username correlation.

### Company Recon Simulation
Mapped a real startup's team, tech stack, and web exposure using OSINT tools such as BuiltWith, LinkedIn, and Google Dorking.

### Social Media Intelligence Mapping
Analyzed a public profile's online behavior, location habits, and social connections based on content patterns and geotags.
